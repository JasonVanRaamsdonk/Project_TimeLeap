# Project_TimeLeap

Abstract
I purpose to introduce accurate and restore old black and white photos that suffer from damage degradation (scratches, fading, missing sections etc.) through a deep learning approach. TimeLeap (pending focus group) will be accessible to all as the endpoint for me is to host the application online. This way a user can file upload the black and white image, the code will run in the background, then the user will be greeted with coloured image and a new perspective. Currently it is possible to restore colour to a black and white photography, however, the methods are often painstaking. Photochrom; adding up to 15 layers of colour to a single photo negative. Although good, does not result in a super realistic photo. More recently, digital colourisation; using a vast number online resources, alongside photoshop and similar tools, have made it possible for artists to reconstruct images with more accuracy. However, the skill threshold and wealth of time needed are greatly inaccessible. The purpose of my project is to mitigate this, by making photo colourisation/restoration available to everyone, allowing them to see history not as a linear timeline, but rather a tapestry of all these rich moments, lost in the dullness of a black and white photo.

Beyond the fact that these coloured/restored photos are really enjoyable to look at, colourisation presents a new perspective on history. They offer a more relatable look at capture moments.
